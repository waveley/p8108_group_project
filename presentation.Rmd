# Background

## Superficial Bladder Cancer

- Also known as Stage 1 bladder cancer
- Common diagnosis (75% of bladder cancer cases$^1$) and rarely life-threatening on its own.
- Thought to arise due to urinary issues$^1$ or through "abnormalities of tryptophan metabolism"$^2$
- Natural history study conducted in Sweden saw that "death was directly related to tumor grade, number of tumors, and volume of recurrences."$^3$

## Pyridoxine and Thiotepa

- _Pyridoxine_ (vitamin $B_6$) thought to reduce "abnormalities of tryptophan metabolism"
- _Thiotepa_ has been the standard of care for the treatment of superficial bladder cancers.
- Effects of these two therapies compared in randomized clinical trial conducted by Byar and Blackard in 1977

## Byar and Blackard (1977)

- Primary clinical interest: prevent and reduce recurrence of Stage 1 bladder cancer.
- Event time agnostic analysis conducted included comparing overall rates and percentages of occurrence between groups
  - Pairwise difference detected in rate of recurrence between thiotepa and placebo, and thiotepa and pyridoxine
  - No other differences in event incidence between groups detected
- Survival analysis conducted involved the construction of life-table estimates.
  - Life-table analysis indicate that the time to first recurrence was significantly different between pyridoxine and placebo groups.
  - Secondary analysis restricted to subjects who experienced recurrence after at least 10 months of follow-up

# Proposed Project

## Motivation

- Clinical interest in seeing if any of the three treatments decrease incidence of event (recurrence, death) or time to those events.
- Research ought to be reproducible, especially if data are open-source

## Analysis Plan

1. Use non-survival analysis methods to see if differences in recurrence and overall status exist between treatment groups, irrespective of time.
2. Construct survival models to analyze recurrence trends to see if differences exist between treatment groups in time to first recurrence, with initial tumor number and initial largest tumor size as covariates. 
  - Semi-parametric: Cox Proportional Hazards Model
  - Parametric: Weibull and Exponential Models 
  - Non-parametric: KM
3. Compare results to original Byar and Blackard study.

# 1. Non-Survival Analysis

## Absolute Comparison: Counts of Events by Treatment (Poisson Regression)

`glm(n ~ status + recur + treatment, family = "quasipoisson")`


```{r}
final_counts <- 
  final_status %>% 
  mutate(treatment = str_to_title(treatment),
         status = factor(status),
         recur = factor(recur)) %>%

  summarise(n = n(),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  complete(treatment, status, recur) %>%
  replace_na(list(n = 0)) %>%
  arrange(treatment, status, recur)

count_glm <- glm(n ~ status + recur + treatment, data = final_counts, family = "quasipoisson")

# quasipoisson specified to adjust for overdispersion (not much, as DP is 1.517)
# indicates distribution of counts by final status and recurrence do not differ between groups
count_glm %>% broom::tidy() %>% filter(term %in% c("treatmentPyridoxine", "treatmentThiotepa")) %>% knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

## Relative Comparison: Frequencies of Events by Treatment (Chi-square Test)

```{r}
patient_summary <- 
  bladder1 %>% 
  group_by(id, treatment) %>% 
  mutate(
    time_diff = stop - start
  ) %>%
  summarise(
    total_time_in_study = sum(time_diff),
    total_recurrence = sum(status == 1),
    recurrence_rate =
      case_when(
        total_time_in_study == 0 ~ 0,
        TRUE ~ total_recurrence/total_time_in_study) * 100,
    .groups = "drop"
  ) 

treatment_summary <- patient_summary %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    total_obs = n(),
    total_time_observed = sum(total_time_in_study),
    total_recurrences = sum(total_recurrence),
    calculated_recurrence_rate = total_recurrences/total_time_observed,
    avg_recurrence_rate = mean(recurrence_rate),
    scaled_recurrence_rate = calculated_recurrence_rate * 100
  )

to_chi_sq <- patient_summary %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    any_recurrence = sum(total_recurrence > 0),
    no_recurrence = sum(total_recurrence == 0)
  ) 

to_chi_sq %>% knitr::kable()
chisq.test(to_chi_sq[2:3] %>% as.matrix())
```

## Relative Comparison: Rates of Events by Treatment (F-test)

- Assume that time to first recurrence follows an exponential distribution.
- Cox (1953)$^4$ proposes a pairwise comparison of rates by using the test statistic $F = \frac{T_1/(d_1 + 0.5)}{T_2/(d_2+0.5)}$
  - $T_1$ and $T_2$: total patient time for each treatment group
  - $d_1$ and $d_2$: total number of events for each treatment group
  - Degrees of freedom: $v_1 = (v_1' + v_1^*/2) = 2d_1 + 1$ and $v_2 = (v_2' + v_2^*/2) = 2d_2 + 1$

## Relative Comparison: Rates of Events by Treatment (F-test)

```{r}
rate_comparison <- function(comparison, t1, t2, d1, d2){
  f_stat <- (t1/(d1 + 0.5))/(t2/(d2 + 0.5))
  p_value <- pf(f_stat, 2*d1 + 1, 2*d2 + 1)
  return(list(
   comparison = comparison,
   p_value = p_value
  ))
}

# placebo vs. pyro
rate_comparison("placebo vs. pyro", 1528, 993, 87, 57)

# placebo vs. thio

# 3. Review of Original Study

## Review of Original Study

- Original study primarily focused on non-survival approaches, most results of which we were able to reproduce.
  - Only discrepancy existed wih original investigators reporting significant difference in rate of recurrence between both placebo/thiotepa and pyridoxine/thiotepa comparisons
  - Our analysis only indicated a significant difference in recurrence rate between placebo/thiotepa, consistent with KM findings
- Survival analysis results were similar
  - No difference between groups were found in the non-parametric approaches (KM in our project and life table in original study).

## Difference in Survival Curves after 10 months?

<center>
  ![Byar and Blackard (1977)](image/rate_mc_issue.png)
</center>

- Notwithstanding the accuracy of this statement, this p-value actually should not be taken as significant. 
- 6 comparisons will have been conducted in total, need to adjust for multiple comparison (significance level will be < 0.03 if using Bonferroni's adjustment)

# Conclusion

## Conclusion

- Treatments proposed in this study seemed to be much less effective than hypothesized in the prevention of superficial bladder cancer recurrence in both recurrence incidence and time-to-recurrence outcomes.
  - Thiotepa appears to have some effect in reducing rate of recurrence.
- Most results in study are reproducible, with some multiple comparison discrepancies.
- Natural history of superficial bladder cancer may have impacted non-significance of most results
  - Surgical treatments are usually most effective$^{1, 5}$
- Future studies can consider collecting time-varying covariates to improve ability to model time-to-recurrence outcome.
